BINARY SEARCH TREE
the root value should e greater than left sub tree and smaller than the right subtree-->WRONG MISCONCEPTION
this above statement is wrong
root.val>max(LST) && root.val<min(RST)->correct
Can a BST can contain duplicate elements? YES, in general a BST contains unique elements
but if it is given in the question then see the definition of BST in the ques and solve accordingly.
Find minimum and maximum of a BST

Advantages of BST:
Efficient Searching
Efficient insertion and deletion
Usage in implementation of other data structures like sets, maps, priority queues

Diadvantages:
Lack of support for range queries
Not that efficient in case of Unbalanced Trees

Applications:
Phonebook
Dictionary
Stock Market analysis

You have 3 nodes with different value how many unique BST can be formed?
only one possible way(since BST needs to follow a set of properties)

Search element in the BST:
-in BST we do not need to search the entire tree
-3 case:
root.val==target
root.val< target
root.val>target

Inorder Traversal in BST:
               10
             /     \ 
            7      14
           / \     / \
          3   8   11  12   
      inorder: 3 7 8 10 11 14 21 <sorted>
after inorder traversal of a BST we always get a sorted list

Consider a binary Tree with n nodes. What is the maximum possible height of the tree?
-> n
minimum possible height? -> logn

Consider a BST with n nodes. What is the worst case of time complexity inc ase of searchinf->log n

Validate BST: the inorder will always be in ascending order for the BST

Lowest common ancestor:
of BST:
-if root exist and p is in  the LST and q is in the right subtree and if p's value is less than root 
and q's value is greater than root then the LCA is root
-both the values of p and q are less than r ->move root to the left->recursively apply the above check
- if both val of p and q becomes greter than root-> move to right}
